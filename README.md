Hello, this is my leetcode journey :)

### Jul/2/2023 - [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/)
```
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
```

### Jul/2/2023 - [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/)

### June/29/2023 - [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)
```
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

```
### June/29/2023 - [buildArrayFromPermutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-array-from-permutation/description/)
```
Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.

A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
Output: [0,1,2,4,5,3]
Explanation: The array ans is built as follows: 
ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
    = [nums[0], nums[2], nums[1], nums[5], nums[3], nums[4]]
    = [0,1,2,4,5,3]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,0,1,2,3,4]
Output: [4,5,0,1,2,3]
Explanation: The array ans is built as follows:
ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
    = [nums[5], nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4]]
    = [4,5,0,1,2,3]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] < nums.length
The elements in nums are distinct.
 

Follow-up: Can you solve it without using an extra space (i.e., O(1) memory)?

### June/19/2023 - [largestAltitude](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/description/)
```
There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.

 

Example 1:

Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
Example 2:

Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
```
### June/12/2023 - [summaryRanges](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/)
```
You are given a sorted unique integer array nums.

A range [a,b] is the set of all integers from a to b (inclusive).

Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of nums is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer x such that x is in one of the ranges but not in nums.

Each range [a,b] in the list should be output as:

"a->b" if a != b
"a" if a == b
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"
```

### Feb/8/2023 - [maxDepth](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses)
```
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

depth("") = 0
depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.
Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
Output: 3
```
### Jan/08/2023 - easy Array mergeSortedArray.js   
### Jan/23/2023 - [Squares of a Sorted Array]
```
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
### Jan/24/2023 - [Two sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
```

### Jan/25/2023 - [Plus one](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)
```
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
```

### Jan/26/2023 - [validParentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses)
```
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
```

### Feb/1/2023 - [removeOuterParentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-outermost-parentheses/description/)
```
A valid parentheses string is either empty "", "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.

For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings.
A valid parentheses string s is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into s = A + B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings.

Given a valid parentheses string s, consider its primitive decomposition: s = P1 + P2 + ... + Pk, where Pi are primitive valid parentheses strings.

Return s after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of s.
