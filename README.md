### Jan/23/2023 - Squares of a Sorted Array
```
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

```
[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Jan/25/2023 - [Plus one](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)
```
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
